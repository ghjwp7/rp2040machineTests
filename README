========================================
PIO, DMA, Timer tests / demos
========================================

This repo contains several small test or demonstration programs, for
PIO, DMA, Timer devices on an RP2040-based system, as typified by a
Raspberry Pi Pico.

------------------

🔵 See `README-PIO-DMAtest2 <README-PIO-DMAtest2>`_ for description of
`PIO-DMAtest2 <PIO-DMAtest2.py>`_ and its results.  `PIO-DMAtest2`
sets up several DMA channels, chained in a loop to run until shut
down.  Includes DMA interrupt handler and scheduled-callback.

------------------

🔵 See `README-calibratePulse8b <README-calibratePulse8b>`_ for
description of `calibratePulse8b <calibratePulse8b.py>`_ and its
results.  It generates and times series of pulses and produces
histogram data for pulse widths.  Not yet using DMA.  Runs ok at
NEdges=343500, WaveFreq=10000 but has issues at slightly higher
numbers.

------------------

🔵 See `README-PIO-DMAtest1 <README-PIO-DMAtest1>`_ for description of
`PIO-DMAtest1 <PIO-DMAtest1.py>`_, a demonstration of putting RP2040
PIO State Machine output into memory, via DMA transfer.  That `README`
describes a PIO-DMA test program and shows example output.

------------------

🔵 See `README-readTimerReg <README-readTimerReg>`_ for description of
`readTimerReg3 <readTimerReg3.py>`_, a micropython program that
reads an RP2040's main timer register several ways.  That `README`
describes the test program and shows example output.  The program can
test at multiple system frequencies.

------------------

🔵 See `README-showDMAregisters <README-showDMAregisters>`_ for
description of `showDMAregisters <showDMAregisters.py>`_, a
micropython program that looks at RP2040 DMA register contents via a
`memoryview` object supplied by `DMA.registers`.  That `README`
describes the test program and shows example output for three DMA
channels it sets up.

------------------

🔵 See `README-DMA_CtrlReg <README-DMA_CtrlReg>`_ for description of
`DMA_CtrlReg.py <DMA_CtrlReg.py>`_ and `testDCR.py <testDCR.py>`_, a
demonstration of decoding RP2040 DMA control register contents.  That
`README` lists helper routines that can be imported from
`DMA_CtrlReg` and shows output from test program `testDCR.py`.

------------------

Note, code tests mentioned in these READMEs ran on an RP2040
board with MicroPython v1.25.0, via Thonny 3.3.14 IDE on an
ubuntu.22.04 Linux system.  The board is labeled 'RP2040-Zero' but
detects as 'Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040'::

    MicroPython v1.25.0-preview.160.gc73204128 on 2024-12-30; Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040
    Type "help()" for more information.
