========================================
PIO, DMA, Timer tests / demos
========================================

This repo contains several small test or demonstration programs, for
PIO, DMA, Timer devices on an RP2040-based system, as typified by a
Raspberry Pi Pico.

------------------

ðŸ”µ See `README-lPIODMAt <README-lPIODMAt>`_ for description of
`littlePIO-DMAtest1 <littlePIO-DMAtest1.py>`_, a demonstration of
putting RP2040 PIO State Machine output into memory, via DMA transfer.
That `README` describes a PIO-DMA test program and shows example
output.

------------------

ðŸ”µ See `README-readTimerReg <README-readTimerReg>`_ for description of
`readTimerReg.py <readTimerReg.py>`_, a demonstration of directly
reading an RP2040's main timer register several ways.  That `README`
describes the test program and shows example output.  The program
tests at multiple system frequencies.

------------------

ðŸ”µ See `README-sDMAregs <README-sDMAregs>`_ for description of
`showDMAregisters.py <showDMAregisters.py>`_, a demonstration of
looking at RP2040 DMA register contents via a `memoryview` object
supplied by `DMA.registers`.  That `README` describes the test program
and shows example output for three DMA channels it sets up.

------------------

ðŸ”µ See `README-dmaCRB <README-dmaCRB>`_ for description of
`dmaCtrlRegBits.py <dmaCtrlRegBits.py>`_ and `testDCRB.py
<testDCRB.py>`_, a demonstration of decoding RP2040 DMA control
register contents.  That `README` lists helper routines that can be
imported from `dmaCtrlRegBits.py` and shows output from test program
`testDCRB.py`.

------------------

Note, code tests mentioned in these READMEs ran on an RP2040
board with MicroPython v1.25.0, via Thonny 3.3.14 IDE on an
ubuntu.22.04 Linux system.  The board is labeled 'RP2040-Zero' but
detects as 'Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040'::

    MicroPython v1.25.0-preview.160.gc73204128 on 2024-12-30; Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040
    Type "help()" for more information.
