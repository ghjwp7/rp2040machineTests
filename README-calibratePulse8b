==================================================
PIO pulse measurement calibration program 8b
==================================================

**Context:** For a pulse-timing application in a different repo,
signals recur in a series of 0.1 second windows, with dozens of pulses
per window and pulse widths ranging from around 8 us up to about 80
us.  `calibratePulse8` is a test demo of one technique for timing
edges of pulses.  This program uses regularly-repeating square waves
to verify that the counter doesn't lose or gain count cycles.  In
later code, the mechanisms used here may allow an RP2040 app to time 4
independent signal sets of erratic pulses at a resolution of 2
system-clock cycles.

Note, 8b testing requires a jumper between two pins that are selected
via declarations like ``W_out_Pin=const(13)`` and
``C_in_Pin=const(12)).``

Note!  This version sets system frequency as specified in a line like
``SysFreq=const(120000000)`` or ``SysFreq=const(180000000)``, ie, at
other than 125 MHz.  Intent: Get nicer numbers for nominal counts, to
make errors show up more obviously.  Also note: debug printing usually
is commented out before commits but not necessarily always.

At present, `calibratePulse8` handles data from the PIO fifo on the
fly.  It would be better if data were handled via a good-sized
buffers, rather than a small fifo, to allow more time leeway when
bursty pulse sequences occur.  At some point, if noise or other
factors necessitate more-elaborate data processing, it may be
necessary to apply ``@micropython.viper`` instead of
``@micropython.native`` to time-critical processing.  Both of those
decorators compile python code to native machine code.  Viper is
faster but requires typing etc.  Code as of 21 Jan 2025 can keep up
with analyzing a 12 kHz signal, but stumbles at 13 KHz.

Future:  Use DMA storage buffers + 2 CPUs


How the counter works
---------------------------

**Overview:** An RP2040 PIO state machine is used to poll a pin while
decrementing a counter.  When an edge change occurs, a two-word packet
with counter value and an edge-polarity mark-code is stored.  Storing
the counter takes up a few cycles, during which the counter doesn't
decrement.  However, PIO code uses extra decrement operations to make
up for that gap, as explained in a later section.

==========  ============================================  =======
Mark Code      Denotation                                 Value
==========  ============================================  =======
GFall        Falling-edge packet                           0
GRise        Rising-edge packet                            1
==========  ============================================  =======

**Details:** The counter State Machine has two parts, similar in form.
One looks for rising edges, the other for falling edges, in spin loops
that take two state machine cycles and decrement a register by 1
during each loop.  This makes a 2-machine-cycles-per-count counter,
thus a 62.5 MHz count loop if system clock is 125 MHz.  Whenever an
edge change is detected, the state machine stores a two-word data
packet, with a ``GRise`` or ``GFall`` mark-code for rising or falling
in the first word and a counter value in the second.  Move, set, and
push operations to store mark words and values use up several cycles
per edge, during which the usual every-other-cycle decrements get
missed.  This requires make-up decrements, as covered in more detail
in section "Make-up Decrements Notes".

The pin test available in a PIO State Machine does a jump if a pin is
set.  The rising-edge spin-while-low loop tests a pin, and if it's
set, jumps to store data, else falls into the decrement+jump that
closes the spin loop.  On the other hand, the falling-edge
spin-while-high loop does a decrement first, then uses a pin-test jump
to close the spin loop.

**What main() does** -- ``main()`` prints out setup info (eg, system
frequency and wave frequency and duty); uses ``makeSMwave`` to set up
the wave machine; calls ``takeReadings()`` to run test and collect
data; displays summary report; and calls ``shoHisto()`` to print out
histogram data that was accumulated during the readings phase.  The
outputs show how many pulses were measured as in their expected time
ranges.

**What takeReadings() does** -- This routine begins by creating lists
of histogram-bin limits, and zeroing counts in bins.  Next, it has a
data collection loop headed by ``while i < NEdges:``.  In that
``while`` loop, statements ``mark = csm.get()`` and ``xlast =
csm.get()`` do blocking reads from the counter's fifo.  The first of
those reads is followed by a loop that keeps reading if ``mark`` isn't
a GRise or GFall value.  Each extra read counts as a skip (but not as
an edge).  Once an ok mark and value are available, ``d = xlast -
xprev; xprev = xlast`` computes ``d``, which is the time in counts
since previous edge detection.  Finally, a histogram bin for value
``d`` is located and incremented.

When enough edges have been processed, ``takeReadings()`` returns its
accumulated data to ``main()``, which as noted above calls
``shoHisto()`` to print it out.  See following output, with comments
after.

Note, ignore any nomCy values below shown as NA (due to former code error).

**to do:** have a dma with no read or write advance.  in=TIMELR, out=mem,
with irq to copy the mem word to small buffer + circ buffer.
  
**was to do**, now works ok: have front loops in counter sm to wait
for up, wait for down, jump to store falling edge, to synchronize csm
and make later analysis cleaner.  This didn't help at first, because
the wait-for-high-level loop was in main thread, not PIO, and seemed
to lose 50-70 cycles.  But moving the csm into PIO 1 -- rather than
having csm and wsm in same PIO -- freed up a couple of words to allow
wait-for-high-level loop to be in PIO as part of csm, which works well.

**was to do**, gives ok results, but needs work: with small buffer +
circ buffer save first 8 & last 8 words, to get better comparison of
Counted time vs Predicted time.  Data collection for this is in code
now.  Example of output for this feature is like last lines of
following, which ran at 180 MHz::

343600 vs 344000 edges
---------------------------------------------

The next two outputs are from runs that captured 343600 and 344000
edges, respectively, the former running just fine, the latter not.

The first run detected 171800 rising and falling edges each, totalling
343600 edges, as expected. 171799 edges were in the main bins of
histogram results, ie 6054 counts for down time and 196 counts for up
time, with one rising edge count 50 or more away from the main bin.

The second run detected 344000 edges, as expected, but somehow counted
10 more rising than falling edges.  This is due to an unexplained
problem in the code or processing method.  64 skips occurred in
processing; that is, 64 times when a GRise or GFall mark code was
expected, something else occurred, indicating fifo might have filled
or something else happened.  This may be due to an unexplained problem
in the code.  Note, 10000*2**32/125000000 ~ 343597.38, where
10000 is wave frequency, 32 is register size, and 125000000 is the
system frequency the test ran at, and some overflow still to be found
may be occurring somewhere in the code.

Make-up Decrements Notes
----------------------------

When storing and make-up is going on, the counter is ignoring pin
values -- that is, storage and make-up intervals are dead times, of
about 11 system cycles (or 5.5 counter counts) per measured edge.  At
a 125 MHz clock, that's about 88 ns.  Pulses shorter than that, or
dropouts shorter than that, are likely to confuse the counter.

As just noted, move, set, and push operations to store mark words and
values use 11 counter counts per rising edge + falling edge sequence.
**Several points to discuss: 1,** in a series of extra decrement
instructions to make up for missed counts, half make up for missed
decrements, and half keep up with where the clock should be during the
make up process.  **2,** it's possible to compensate for lost counting
time in application code, and cut counter dead time in half.  **3,**
the number of lost counts differs slightly between the rising edge and
falling edge cases; as detailed later, attributing 6 counts to
falling- and 5 to rising-edge make-up works well.

Item **1** is fairly obvious; basically, if we miss 5.5 decrements per
wave cycle we need 11 extra decrements per cycle, 5.5 to make up for
missed decrements, and 5.5 to keep up with where the clock should be
during the make up process.

For item **2,** note that the code that reads PIO counter results
could maintain its own running-total cycle compensation count to add
to each raw counter output.  The total updates with an edge-specific
amount after each read.  An early version of the calibratePulse code
used that approach, and also included a de-noise / de-bounce step with
appropriate count compensation amounts for detected noise.  With noise
testing, counter dead time lengthens substantially; without it,
app-level compensation shortens dead time by about 44 ns per edge, at
the cost of more-complex and more-time-consuming application code.


For item **3,** test results shown below indicate that a 6-5 split is
the best division of make-up decrements between falling- and
rising-edge stores.  This is close to what manual inspection of the
PIO code suggests.
 
Tests to compare results at various splits were run using 50% duty
cycle waves at frequencies 440, 500, 600, 700 Hz.  System frequency
was set at 120 MHz with the idea of improving 500 and 600 Hz cycle
accuracy.  In the test data, ``totGR`` represents the total measured
low signal and ``totGF`` total measured high signal.  That is,
``totGR`` is the sum of all the interval sizes before a rising edge,
and ``totGF`` is the sum of all the interval sizes before a falling
edge.

When measuring is done correctly, and with an even number of edges,
``totGR = totGF``; that is, low signal time equals high signal time,
so their counts should be equal.  Error statistic ``kerr`` is
``totGR - totGF``.  NE=number of edges measured (after the first).
``krn`` = counts difference between last rising edge and first rising
edge. ::

Note that ``kerr`` values are, roughly, multiples of the number of
cycles tested, ie 8000/2.  Placing more decrements just after the
falling-edge store will attribute more cycles to rising-edge totals,
and vice versa.  For example, the progressions of ``kerr`` values for
440 and 700 Hz are about 4000 * -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 as we have 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 decrements (of 11 total) directly after the falling-edge
store.  For 500 and 600 Hz the progressions are like 4000 * -4, -2,
-2, 0, 0, 2.  In the 440 and 700 Hz cases, clearly a 6-5 split is
best, while in the 500 and 600 Hz cases, either of 6-5 or 7-4 is
suitable.

Precisely what's happening in the 500 and 600 Hz cases isn't clear to
me but I imagine the "proper" division of decrements might be 6.5-4.5,
so that 6-5 and 7-4 are similar distances from correct.  This notion
doesn't explain 4-7 and 5-6 behaving alike at 500 and 600 Hz.

Note, RP2040 square waves from simple PIOs for wave frequencies like
440 and 700 are imperfect.  At frequent intervals, the wave state
machine clock adds or drops a system cycle as dictated by the
fractional-division state machine clock generator.  Thus, pulse widths
at those frequencies vary (repeatably) by one system cycle, ie about 8
nanoseconds, which is enough to make an occasional 1-count difference
and enlarge ``kerr`` values.  On the other hand, variation of pulse
widths for 500 and 600 Hz waves is probably on the order of
picoseconds.

Note, several more error-data tables appeared in earlier versions of
this README.  Those are now obsolete...
