readTimerReg.py
========================================

**Aim:**  On an RP2040, `readTimerReg.py` demonstrates directly
accessing the RP2040's main timer register.  (RP2040 = processor in
Raspberry Pi Pico and many other boards.)

Four times each for each of three modes, `readTimerReg` takes 9
successive timer readings, subtracting a `t0` value from each.  After
taking all its readings, `readTimerReg` prints them out (grouped by
reading mode) and prints reading-to-reading values as well.

The three modes tested are: ðŸ”¸calling `ticks_us()`, as imported from
`utime`; ðŸ”¸accessing the TIMELR register at 12+TIMER_BASE =
12+0x40054000 via `mem32[]`; and ðŸ”¸accessing it via a `ptr32()`
reference within a viper-translated function.

Unsurprisingly, viper-compiled code is by far the fastest.  On the
other hand, code using mem32[] is rather slow.

In the output shown below, four runs for each mode are grouped
together.  Modes are shown in the mentioned order, ie, using
`ticks_us()`, using `mem32[]`, and using `ptr32()`.  The lefthand 9
numbers on each line are timer readings minus a `t0` starting time.
The righthand 9 numbers on each line are difference between
consecutive values.

The output shown is from an unusual run (at default system frequency,
125 MHz) where the last three `ptr32()` runs all had the same results.
In most runs, there were small variations (a tick or two) in times for
the `ptr32()` mode.

Tests run at other clock rates than the 125 MHz default system
frequency are discussed below, after the next section.

ðŸ”µ Lines p-s show results of using `mem32[]` references to the
`TIMELR` register, as explained in section 4.6.5. of the RP2040
Datasheet.  That section has a lengthy list of timer registers,
together with their offsets from `TIMER_BASE`, the base address for
memory-mapped timer registers.  Loop times averaged around 38 Î¼s per
pass. ::

ðŸ”µ Lines u-x show results of using `ptr32()` [which is available
within viper-compiled code] to access `TIMELR`.  This method is able
to store timer readings at 4 Î¼s intervals, with each reading offset
against a `t0` value. ::

   Tests run at other clock rates
--------------------------------------

In its current version, `readTimerReg` will run sets of tests at
various system frequencies not below `underLimit` or above
`speedLimit`, as set at the beginning of `main`.  Let f0 be the system
frequency (typically 125 MHz) when the program starts.  `main` calls
`runTest(f)` for each in-limits frequency `f` from the list (f0,
100000000, 200000000, 250000000, f0).  Note, `runTest(f)` may try
twice to set a requested system frequency, because the program did not
succeed in changing from 250 MHz to 125 MHz with only one try.

Note, frequencies beyond 133 MHz are out-of-spec for the RP2040, and
the program as shown says `speedLimit = 133000001`.  However, in my
testing it worked ok at 200 MHz and 250 MHz, with the times for the
first and third access methods always decreasing proportionately to
system cycle time.

Times for `mem32[]` access, on the other hand, were sometimes
anomalous.  If `underLimit` and `speedLimit` both are 125000000, loop
times typically average around 38 Î¼s per pass.  With `speedLimit` at
250000000, loop times typically average half that.  However, as seen
in the following results (from successive `runTest` passes) `mem32[]`
access times (lines p,q,r,s) on occasion sharply decreased, to less
than half their typical values::

    System frequency = 250000000 Hz

    System frequency = 125000000 Hz

The decrease persisted in many subsequent runs, disappearing when I
set `underLimit` and `speedLimit` both to 125000000, and not reliably
reappearing later with other limits.
