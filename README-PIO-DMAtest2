PIO-DMAtest2
========================================

**Aim:** `PIO-DMAtest2` is a test / demo of putting RP2040 PIO State
Machine output into memory, via DMA transfer with DMA interrupts and
chaining.  It acts as follows:

• Creates a state machine `smx` to increment a counter by 3 between stores
• Sets up three chained DMA channels that get words from `smx` and
  store into buffers
• Runs a wait loop that analyzes current results each time a buffer fills

Note, `smx` has its two 4-word fifos Rx and Tx combined into one
8-word Rx fifo.

Example output appears below, taken with state machine `smx` producing
words at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 KHz.  Output for each test case begins
with system frequency, followed by state-machine data -- step
frequency, steps per cycle, and cycle frequency.  For example, at 20
KHz SM cycle::

    System frequency   = 125000000
    SM  step frequency =    120000 Hz =  8 us
    SM steps per cycle =         6
    SM cycle frequency =  20000.00 Hz = 50 us
    Data collects during next 48000 us, w/progress notes

The main thread prints headings, and then, after each full-buffer
interrupt and callback, prints out action times, buffer min and max,
and sequence-check results, typically in 15 lines of data -- three DMA
channels each making five buffer fills. Each buffer fill overwrites a
buffer.

Each data line shows a numbered entry with the time of a DMA
interrupt, how long before callback and processing started, and buffer
analysis -- min, max, sequence check.  For example::

    Entry    Interrupt   Microseconds to    First    Range     OK
     #  DMA#  time, us  Callback & Report   value   min-max   steps
     3   0     153779      25      200       1155  1155-1344   63

This shows the third entry for DMA channel 0.  The third interrupt for
that channel occurred about 153779 microseconds after DMA channels
were created.  About 25 us after the interrupt, when callback got
scheduled, the callback routine started.  That routine stored
interrupt and callback times, and increased the in-records index,
`rri`.  About 200 us after the interrupt, the main thread's busy loop
saw `rro<rri` and wrote the data line shown, to say that DMA channel
0's buffer's word 0 holds 1155; that min and max are 1155 and 1344;
and that 63 of the buffer's 64 entries are 3 more than the previous
entry, all as expected for the third buffer fill for channel 0 of 3
channels.  Note, the previous buffer -- fill 2 for DMA 2 -- ended with
1152, which is 3*3*64*2 = step*chans*bufwords*fills.

This section contains output from runs with SM cycle frequency = 20,
25, 30, 35, and 40 KHz.  Output from the last is incomplete; for more

In the 20 and 25 KHz runs, all results are nominal, with one caveat --
times of interrupts are about 4500 us more than I expected.  At 20
KHz, buffer fill should take 3200 us, so interrupt times should be
3200, 6400, 9600, ... but instead are 4500-4600 more than that.  At 25
KHz , buffer fill should take 2560 us, so interrupt times should be
2560, 5120, 7680, ... but again are 4500-4600 more.  Note, 10000 us
'postti' and 100000 us extra for completion are accounted for; they
don't explain the 4500 us issue.

That aside, we see that callbacks occur at orderly times, fairly soon
after being scheduled by the interrupt handler, with delays in these
examples ranging mostly from 28 to 70 us, plus one outlier at 208 us.
Delays from interrupt to main-thread processing range from 140 to 356
us.  Every buffer contained its expected data, as shown by orderly
ascent of numbers in the "First value" and "Range min-max" columns,
and exactly 63 OK steps for every buffer.

In the 30 KHz run (above) all results are nominal, but obviously the
CPU is not quite keeping up with the data rate -- delay between
interrupt and associated callback grows steadily, until DMA 0 shuts
off, after which it drops.  Sequence results all are nominal and
correct. That is not the case in the 35 KHz run; sequence results are
not all correct::

As can be seen, numerous anomalies occurred in the 35 KHz run.  First
value in buffer often is not the min value, and OK step counts several
times isn't 63.

"Impossible" results can occur because OK steps are counted in a loop
that completes before the print statement in which first/min/max are
calculated and printed.  Those calculations saw different buffer
contents than the step counting loop. Of course, the steps loop could
be rewritten to also compute first/min/max.  That probably would keep
buffer checking ahead of buffer filling, for this case of only 5
buffer fills per channel, but not handle much more than that.
However, speeds of 50-60 KHz would be feasible if using both of the
CPUs on the RP2040, as described next.

Multiprocessing Example
------------------------------------------

With two CPUs and three DMA buffers, one buffer can be filling while
the other two are being processed.  For example, suppose it takes 2000
us to fill a buffer, and 2500 us to process it.

Further suppose DMA 2 has been filling buffer 2 for 100 us; that CPU 0
has been processing buffer 0 for 2100 us; and that CPU 1 has been
processing buffer 1 for 100 us.

In another 400 us, CPU 0 will go idle, done with buffer 0.  Another
1500 us along, DMA 2 will finish filling buffer 2, and trigger DMA 0
to begin filling buffer 0.  At this point, CPU 1 has 500 us of
processing left to finish with buffer 1, and CPU 0 has 2500 us of
processing to do with buffer 2.  And so forth.

Output: Run at 40 KHz
-----------------------------

During the 40 KHz run, the RP2040 hung up and did not resume proper
working until I pressed its reset button and clicked thonny's
stop/restart button.  This fairly dependably made the RP again usable
via thonny, but after one crash it was necessary to power-cycle to
resume.  I don't have an explanation for how these crashes occurred --
I intended to write ISR and callback routines that don't crash even at
overwhelming data rates.  Note, one observation re avoidable hangs:
using a return early in the callback routine (rather than 'falling off
the end' to exit) produced hangs.  ::
